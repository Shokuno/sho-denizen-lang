# sho-denizen-lang
This is a TextMate Grammar Language pack for the Atom Text editor. It concerns the Denizen Scripting Language.

It's purpose is simple, to allow for custom highlighting for the Denizen Scripting Language.
To use the pack you have to donwload the styles and grammar folder and the package.json and put them in the .atom/packages folder.
Once you do this all .yaml and .yml will be highlighted using this packgage. If you don't wanna use it anymore move it to a different folder or delete it.

If you wanna help me out take a look at the atom.io guide to creating a TextMate Grammar.
I do plan on moving this to the TreeSitter grammar at a latter date.
